## CONNECT FOUR
Connect Four is a simple strategy game that can be played with anyone, even young children. It is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe but instead of three, the players must aim to connect four pieces in a straight line (horizontally, vertically and diagonally).

**Objective**

Be the first one to get four of your colored pieces in a straight line.

**Game Play** 

At the start of the game, instructions will be displayed.
There will be two players, Player 1 and Player 2, and each player will each have 32 colored pieces (a total of 64 pieces in the game). Player 1 will have the red pieces and Player 2 will have the green ones. Once the board is displayed, the first turn would be the Player 1. The next is automatically the Player 2. They will take turn in placing their pieces until one of them wins. Turns entails in placing new pieces on the board; pieces go to the next available space of the column.

**Technicalities**

* Number of players: 2
* Player 1 – Red, 32 turns
* Player 2 – Green, 32 turns
* Board size – 8 x 8 (64 cells)
* The player presses the column number (1-8) where they want to put their colored piece. The piece will be printed and pile up to the next available space of the column.
* Each turn, the board will be checked to see if there is already a winner.
* Game ends when: 1) there is already a winner or 2) there is no winner, but both run out of colored pieces.
* The game will show the winner (or will inform that no one won) by the end.
